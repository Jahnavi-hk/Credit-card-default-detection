# Credit-card-default-detection

This project is a credit card default prediction system using the UCI Credit Card Default dataset. It compares multiple machine learning models, including custom implementations of Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, along with scikit-learnâ€™s SVM model. The dataset contains demographic and financial attributes of credit card holders, preprocessed using feature selection, normalization, and train-test splitting. The project demonstrates how ensemble models, especially Random Forest (achieving 82.27% accuracy), outperform linear models like SVM and Logistic Regression. The evaluation includes accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports, highlighting the importance of ensemble learning in financial risk prediction.
